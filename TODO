TREK Todo

4. Abstract all of the knowledge base rules to remove all warnings from compilation
5. Create interfaces for rules. Rule specification language
8. Save prompt history and allow user to print that out on the second page so they know the rational for asking for certian items.

Frames to add: gloves, charts and maps, air lounge, barrels, spray skirt, binoculars, tin foil, butter oil, trowel,  synthetic pants, clothelines, book of knots, 

/* NOTES

   Strategies:
   1. Before code is submitted it is run through standard test cases
   2. TODO Code is unit tested using CPPUnit.
   3. A continuous integration strategy is implemented in integrate.sh, which
      follows the following steps
   compile from scratch -> analyze code for taboos (magic numbers etc) -> static
      code analyzers (ex. buffer overflow) -> unit test cases -> format code ->
      commit code
   4. Code can be compiled for either -DDEBUG or -DRELEASE. Development should
      be done using -DDEBUG.
   5. Code should be a 1:1 mapping between functional requirements and
      implementation. References to external documentation should be made within
      the code

   Tactics:
   1. Do not use "assert" in your code.
   2. Use "static_assert" where you can.
   3. TODO A high-level exception catcher in main() should deal with all
      uncaught exceptions, instead of termination (unless that's the right thing
      to do)
   4. TODO Mission-critical processesare run with a
      "manager process" that will respawn the main process if it dies. It is
      also responsible for reporting/logging issues.
   5. Optimizations: functions that are small should use "inline"
   6. Functions not throwing exceptions should make use of the qualifier
      "noexcept"
   7. TODO return types of all functions implemented in this source should
      return an enum type that is very descriptive of the error/success type. Do
      this instead of returning an int and wondering if "1" is success or
      failure
   8. Make use of the D* macros defined in this file to do code traces,
      stack traces or print variable values. They only work when -DDEBUG is used
      in CMakeLists.txt.
   9. Interrupt-style code is favourable over polling code. ex. must refresh
      image after processing on the last one is done instead of looping
      continously and going out of sync
   10. TODO there should be one memory allocation function in the entire src/,
      so that it is easy to quantify and trace memory leaks
   11. Syslog will track system errors (if we decide to use a unix-based
      platform)
